					<p>Ripple users can trade any currency for another without requiring any broker or third-party to facilitate the trades. The process is simple: users submit buy/sell prices to the network and the Ripple protocol automatically finds the best available match and completes the trade.</p>

					<h5 id="step-by-step-guide">Step-By-Step Guide</h5>
					<p>(NOTE: Ripple is in Beta and the currency exchange is only available to users with active accounts and XRP reserves. To learn how to receive XRP, activate your Ripple account, and other developments, please sign-up for our mailing list.)</p>

						<li><a href="https://ripple.com/wallet/">Login</a> to your Ripple wallet.</li>
						<li>Click on the “Advanced” tab.

							<img alt="Currency Guide Step 4" src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/assets/img/currency-guide-step4.jpg">
						</li>
						<li>Click “Change Issuer” to select an issuer for both currencies.(An “issuer” is the Ripple Gateway that allows you to withdraw funds from the Ripple network. For example, Bitstamp.net is a major Ripple Gateway. XRP, the native currency of the Ripple network, does not require an issuer.)
							<img alt="Currency Guide Step 5" src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/assets/img/currency-guide-step5.jpg">
						</li>
						<li>Enter the Public Address of the issuer and Confirm.

							(NOTE: For security purposes, always be sure you have the correct Public Address for your Gateway.)
						</li>
						<li>Look at the Bid, Ask, Spread, and Last Price information to learn about the current market for the selected currency pair.

							<img alt="Currency Guide Step 9" src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/assets/img/currency-guide-step9.jpg">

							<img alt="Currency Guide Step 10" src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/assets/img/currency-guide-step10.jpg">

							<img alt="Currency Guide Step 11" src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/assets/img/currency-guide-step11.jpg">

							<img alt="Currency Guide Step 11.1" src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/assets/img/currency-guide-step11.1.jpg">

							<img alt="Currency Guide Step 12" src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/assets/img/currency-guide-step12.jpg">
							…and your account balances will be updated accordingly.

					<h5 id="cross-currency-payments">Cross-Currency Payments</h5>
					<p>A powerful “side-effect” of Ripple’s distributed exchange is that it allows for automated cross-currency payments at the best available price on a global currency market. Because the Ripple protocol can route payments through its currency exchange, users have the option to make payments in currencies they don’t currently hold.</p>
