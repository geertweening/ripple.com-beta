					<h5 id="who-invented-ripple">Who Invented Ripple</h5>
					<p>Ripple was invented and developed by a group of programmers at Ripple Labs, Inc. A beta version was released in 2013 made open source.</p> 
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="what-is-open-source">What is Open Source?</h5>
					<p>Open Source software is created to be freely available to everyone to use, modify, implement, and develop. Because it is not owned by anyone, no one profits directly from its use. You can read more at the Open Source Initiative (opensource.org).</p>
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
				<h5 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-using-ripple-for-financial-transactions">What are the advantages of using Ripple for financial transactions?</h5>
				<p>An open, shared Internet protocol for financial transactions offers many advantages.</p> 
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Payments are cheaper.</strong> Because Ripple is not owned by anyone, the cost of making payments decreases. Merchants that receive payments via Ripple can save billions of dollars in fees. </li>
					<li><strong>Payments are faster.</strong>Because Ripple transactions are automatic, payments can be processed much faster. By making money available sooner, Ripple can accelerate the economy. </li>
					<li><strong>Currency exchange is easy.</strong> Ripple makes it possible to exchange currencies at no extra charge. This makes international commerce easier and more profitable.</li>
					<li><strong>Finance is accessible.</strong> Because Ripple only requires an Internet connection, it can provide financial services to billions of people in underbanked areas of the world. </li>
					<li><strong>Finance is interconnected.</strong> By creating a shared protocol for money, Ripple makes transactions between independent businesses easy. This reduces friction and inefficiency in the financial system.</li>

			        <tbody>
			          	<tr>
			     			<td><p>All email providers uses the same protocol, SMTP. As a result, you can send email to anyone, even if they use a different email provider. Someone at Gmail can send email to Yahoo or AOL.</p>
								<p>In the same way, people who use the Ripple protocol, RTXP, can send money to each other, no matter what financial service company they use. Customers of a bank that uses Ripple could send money to any other bank or business that uses Ripple.</p>
								<p>Currently, the financial system is made up of many disconnected systems. Ripple creates a way for these systems to become as interconnected and easy as email.</p>
