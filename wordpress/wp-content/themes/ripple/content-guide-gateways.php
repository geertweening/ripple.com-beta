					<h5 id="signing-up-at-gateways">Signing Up at Gateways</h5>
					<p>To sign up at Ripple gateways, you will need to register at their sites and provide some basic information, including your:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Name</li>
						<li>Email</li>
						<li>Ripple Wallet Address</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Be sure to use a valid email address, as gateways will often need to send you a confirmation email in order to activate the account. Once you’ve created a username and secure password, you should be registered and ready to use the gateway.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="funding-your-gateway-account">Funding Your Gateway Account</h5> 
					<p>Putting money into your gateway account will require providing banking information, in order to make transfers from the bank to the gateway and vice versa. Depending on your method of depositing and withdrawing funds at the gateway, the types of information needed will vary, but may include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Your bank account number</li>
						<li>RTN routing number (U.S.)</li>
						<li>IBAN code (International)</li>
						<li>BIC/SWIFT code (International)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section class="guide-section">
				<h5 id="transferring-money-into-your-ripple-wallet">Transferring Money Into Your Ripple Wallet:</h5> 
					<p>After you’re set up at a gateway, you can send money to your Ripple Wallet.</p>
					<p>First, log in to your Wallet and click on the Advanced tab and Trust page. You will need to create a “trust limit” with the gateway for an amount equal to the amount being sent to your Wallet.</p>
					<p>For example, if you deposit $1000 at Bitstamp, you need to create a trust line of at least $1000 to Bitstamp, so that it can deposit $1000 into your Ripple Wallet.</p> 
					<p>Having granted trust to the gateway, you can now send funds to your Ripple Wallet’s address. Go to your gateway’s Withdrawal section and choose Ripple as the transaction method. You can then move money from your account at the gateway into Ripple’s network by sending funds to your Ripple Wallet.</p>
					<p>Bitstamp’s interface is used as an example below:</p>

				</section>
				<section class="guide-section overflow">
				<h5 id="transferring-money-from-your-ripple-wallet"> Transferring Money From Your Ripple Wallet:</h5>
				<p>Sending money to the gateway from your Wallet is simple. You’ll need the specific Ripple address connected to both the gateway and your account. The Deposit section of the gateway should be able to provide you with the information that you need.</p>
				<p>See Bitstamp’s interface below, as an example:</p>
				<img alt="Bitstamp’s Interface Example" src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/assets/img/bitstamp-screenshot1.png">
				<p>After the money arrives to your gateway account from your wallet, you can then cash out via a bank transfer from the gateway to your traditional bank account.</p>

					<p>Now you know how to use gateways to move funds in and out of the Ripple network. It’s the latest evolution in money and the best way for anyone to quickly and conveniently make low-fee payments across currencies, anywhere in the world.</p>
