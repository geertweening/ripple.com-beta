			<section class="guide-section" id="who-invented-ripple">
				<h5>Who invented Ripple?</h5>
				<p>Ripple was invented and developed by a group of programmers at Ripple Labs, Inc. A beta version was released in 2013. After the initial testing is completed will be made open source.</p> 
			</section>
			<section class="guide-section" id="what-is-open-source">
				<h5>What is Open Source?</h5>
				<p>Open Source software is created to be freely available to everyone to use, modify, implement, and develop. Because it is not owned by anyone, no one profits directly from its use. You can read more at the Open Source Initiative (opensource.org). 
			</section>
			<section class="guide-section" id="what-are-the-advantages-of-using-ripple-for-financial-transactions">
				<h5>What are the advantages of using Ripple for financial transactions?</h5>
				<p>An open, shared Internet protocol for financial transactions offers many advantages.</p> 
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Payments are cheaper.</strong> Because Ripple is not owned by anyone, the cost of making payments decreases. Merchants that receive payments via Ripple can save billions of dollars in fees. </li>
					<li><strong>Payments are faster.</strong>Because Ripple transactions are automatic, payments can be processed much faster. By making money available sooner, Ripple can accelerate the economy. </li>
					<li><strong>Currency exchange is easy.</strong> Ripple makes it possible to exchange currencies at no extra charge. This makes international commerce easier and more profitable.</li>
					<li><strong>Finance is accessible.</strong> Because Ripple only requires an Internet connection, it can provide financial services to billions of people in underbanked areas of the world. </li>
					<li><strong>Finance is interconnected.</strong> By creating a shared protocol for money, Ripple makes transactions between independent businesses easy. This reduces friction and inefficiency in the financial system.</li>
				</ul>

								<p>In the same way, people who use the Ripple protocol, RTXP, can send money to each other, no matter what financial service company they use. Customers of a bank that uses Ripple could send money to any other bank or business that uses Ripple.</p>
								<p>Currently, the financial system is made up of many disconnected systems. Ripple creates a way for these systems to become as interconnected and easy as email.</p>

				<h5>Why did Ripple Labs create Ripple?</h5>
				<p>The Internet is a powerful force for good. It allows people to talk to each other across any distance. It brings news from the other side of the world. It lets us share knowledge, images, and ideas.</p>
				<p>However, the Internet is not very good at transactions. Many of the technologies used to send money were invented before the Internet: checks, bank wires, credit cards, etc. As a result they are slow, expensive, and inefficient.</p> 
				<p>Ripple Labs invented Ripple to bring the principles of the Internet to financial transactions.</p>

			     			<td><p>Ripple is not owned or controlled by anyone and is free to use by anyone. So how does Ripple Labs make a profit? It’s simple. Ripple Labs holds many of the XRP currency inside the Ripple network. If Ripple proves useful to the world, then XRP will gain value. The company’s fortune is tied to the utility of Ripple. It is an unconventional profit model, but it has attracted many investors, including Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, IDG Capital, and Google.</p></td>
