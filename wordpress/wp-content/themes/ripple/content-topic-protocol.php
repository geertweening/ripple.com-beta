					<h5 id="math-based">Math-Based</h5>
					<p>RTXP is an algorithm, a process controlled by mathematical principles. Traditional financial systems rely on the integrity of institutions, but Ripple is controlled by the hard rules of math.</p> 
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="distributed">Distributed</h5>
					<p>No one owns or controls the Ripple protocol. It runs on computers around the world, all working together to continually maintain a perfect shared record of accounts, balances, and transactions.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="the-ledger">The Ledger</h5>
					<p>The Ledger is a distributed database -- a perfect, shared record of accounts, balances and transactions in the Ripple network. It is continually and automatically updated by RTXP so that an identical Ledger exists on thousands of servers around the world.  </p>
					<p><strong>Transactions happen instantly.</strong> The time it takes to move money within Ripple is the time it takes to update Ripple’s network of servers, usually just a few seconds.</p>
					<p><strong>XRP is not subject to inflation.</strong>  OpenCoin created 100 billion XRP within the Ripple network, and that amount will never increase.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="consensus">Consensus</h5>
					<p>Every few seconds, the computers running RTXP come to consensus on the state of The Ledger. Payments process. Balances adjust. Transactions execute. Trade complete. And the process begins again.</p>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="secure">Secure</h5>
					<p>Security is the primary function of Ripple. The foundation of any payment system is absolute security -- that’s why RTXP is designed from the ground up to offer superior reliability and safety.</p>

					<h5 id="powerful-apis">Powerful APIs</h5>
					<p>Ripple’s powerful APIs give developers the ability to interact directly with a global real-money network. Check out the our GitHub Repository and get building today.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="open-apis">Open APIs</h5>
					<p>Ripple is open to everyone to build and develop. No fees, approval, or sign-up requirements means you can dive in and start building things today.</p>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="easy-integration">Easy Integration</h5>
					<p>Ripple integration is fast and easy. Developers can easily add Ripple to their software. Businesses can quickly add Ripple to provide advanced financial services to their customers and generate new revenue streams.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="open-source-coming-soon">Open Source (coming soon)</h5>
					<p>Ripple is open-source software. It is not owned or controlled by any person or organization.Anyone can use, develop, expand or modify it for free. </p>
				</section>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="open-client">Open Client</h5>
					<p>The Ripple Client is open-source software that provides users access to their Ripple accounts. A browser-based client <a href="https://ripple.com/client/#/register">is available for free</a> from Ripple.com. However, anyone can freely <a href="https://github.com/ripple/ripple-client">build and modify their own Ripple clients and wallets</a>.</p>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="smart-contracts-coming-soon">Smart Contracts (coming soon)</h5>
					<p>Ripple smart contracts is a scripting language built into RTXP that allows complex financial instruments to be fully automated. Subscriptions, escrow, auctions, crowd-funding, and more -- the possibilities of smart contracts are limitless.</p>
						<blockquote>“Contracts makes Ripple extensible. It lets other developers come in and add completely new features to the Ripple network.  It’s every engineer’s dream to work on a component like this.” <br>
						<cite title="Quote from Stefan Thomas, CTO at OpenCoin"> —Stefan Thomas, CTO at OpenCoin </cite>

					<h5 id="federation-api">Federation API</h5>
					<p>The Federation API is a simple naming protocol based on the same conventions as email.  
					Customers at one business can send payments to customers at another simply by specifying a destination domain. For example, Bob could send a payment to Alice by directing his payment to Alice3000@facebook.com.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="bridge-protocol">Bridge Protocol</h5>
					<p>A bridge protocol is an addition to RTXP that allows payments from Ripple to external networks. For example, the Bitcoin Bridge allows Ripple payments to be sent to any Bitcoin address. Other bridges are being developed, including an email bridge, a SMS bridge, and a bank-account bridge. Ultimately, bridge protocols will allow Ripple payments to be sent to any kind of account.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="dynamic-scalability">Dynamic Scalability</h5>
					<p>Ripple’s dynamic scalability system allows the network to process transactions and trades even under extreme load. When the network is flooded with transactions, RTXP automatically increases the XRP security cost. Users can choose to pay the increased cost or wait for the network load to return to normal. Typically, the increased security cost will be trivial to normal users, but anyone deliberately attempting to flood the network will be forced to stop their attack.</p>
