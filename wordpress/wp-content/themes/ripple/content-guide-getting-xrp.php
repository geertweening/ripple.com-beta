				The purpose of reserve requirements is to prevent ledger spam so they are a nominal amount. These features have a negligible impact on regular users, but their cumulative effect prevents bots or spammers from overloading the network with automatic transaction requests or new accounts.

		<p>it takes only a minimal amount of XRP to activate your account and begin using the Ripple network: the required reserves are equivalent to less than a dollar, and the security cost for each transaction is about 1/1000th of a cent.  These features have a negligible impact on regular users, but their cumulative effect prevents bots or spammers from overloading the network with automatic transaction requests or new accounts.</p>

		<h5 id="xrp-is-a-powerful-digital-currency">XRP is a Powerful Digital Currency</h5>
		<p>XRP is a math-based digital currency that functions as “digital cash” within the Ripple network. Like any currency, XRP has real-world value, and all Ripple users can send and receive money in XRP.</p>
		<p><strong>There’s no third party involved.</strong>  XRP transactions don’t incur any fees or delays from going through a third-party institution like a bank or currency exchange.</p>
		<p><strong>Transactions happen instantly.</strong> The time it takes to move money within Ripple is the time it takes to update Ripple’s network of servers, usually just a few seconds.</p>
		<p><strong>XRP is not subject to inflation.</strong>  Ripple Labs created 100 billion XRP within the Ripple network, and that amount will never increase.</p>
