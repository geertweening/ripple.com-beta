<h4>Math-Based</h4>
<p>Ripple is powered by mathematical algorithms and XRP obeys fixed rules that can never be changed. Thatâ€™s what makes it so secure and reliable. Because no person or organization controls XRP, it cannot be created, falsified, or duplicated.</p>

Direct
XRP payments are direct and peer-to-peer. XRP can be used without any third-parties, intermediaries, or other institutions. 

Distributed
XRP transactions are automatically processed by a global network of computers running the Ripple transaction protocol.   
 
No Counterparty Risk 
No counterparty risk = no chargebacks, frozen accounts, or processing delays. Paying with XRP is as direct and easy as paying with cash.  

No Fees
XRP can be sent directly between any Ripple account without any transaction, network, or operator fees. (The only exception is the XRP security cost, see below.) 

XRP Security System 
XRP plays an important security service within the Ripple network. Every Ripple transaction destroys a tiny amount of XRP. This XRP security cost is insignificant to any normal Ripple user -- even extremely high-volume users will lose, at most, the equivalent of a few pennies. However abusive users who attempt to spam the network with excessive transactions will soon run out of XRP and be forced to stop.
