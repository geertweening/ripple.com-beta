					<h5 id="the-currency-of-the-ripple-network">The Currency of the Ripple Network</h5>
					<p>With the Ripple network, users can send and receive money in any currency for free.  Additionally, Ripple has its own internal currency, known as XRP.  Users need a small amount of XRP to make transactions, and can also use XRP to make direct, instantaneous peer-to-peer payments within the Ripple network.</p>
					<p>You’ll need to acquire a small amount of XRP in order to activate your Ripple account and start using the Ripple network.  Here’s why, and here’s how to get some.</p>
					<p>(If you don’t have an account yet, go here to create a Ripple Wallet.) </p>

					<ol>
						<li>Each user must have a small Account Reserve of 50 XRP in their Ripple Wallet in order to activate their account.</li>
						<li>Each user must have a small Action Reserve of 12.5 XRP in their Ripple Wallet in order to make transactions.</li>
						<li>Each transaction on Ripple costs a tiny fraction of XRP, as a security cost to prevent people from abusing the system.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>it takes only a minimal amount of XRP to activate your account and begin using the Ripple network: the required reserves are equivalent to less than a dollar, and the security cost for each transaction is about 1/1000th of a cent.  These features have a negligible impact on regular users, but their cumulative effect prevents bots or spammers from overloading the network with automatic transaction requests or new accounts.</p>

					<h5 id="xrp-is-a-powerful-digital-currency">XRP is a Powerful Digital Currency</h5>
					<p>XRP is a math-based digital currency that functions as “digital cash” within the Ripple network.  Like any currency, XRP has real-world value, and all Ripple users can send and receive money in XRP.</p>
					<p><strong>There’s no third party involved.</strong>  XRP transactions don’t incur any fees or delays from going through a third-party institution like a bank or currency exchange.</p>
					<p><strong>Transactions happen instantly.</strong> The time it takes to move money within Ripple is the time it takes to update Ripple’s network of servers, usually just a few seconds.</p>
					<p><strong>XRP is not subject to inflation.</strong>  OpenCoin created 100 billion XRP within the Ripple network, and that amount will never increase.</p>

					<h5 id="how-to-get-xrp">How to Get XRP</h5>
					<p>There are two simple ways to get XRP: you can buy XRP directly from a seller, or you can get XRP for free from OpenCoin in one of their giveaways. </p>
