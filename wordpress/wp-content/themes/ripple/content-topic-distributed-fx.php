 				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="global-marketplace">Global Marketplace</h5>
					<p>For the first time, everyone has access to a global currency market without restrictions or fees. You can place orders of any size, in any currency, and the <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>/protocol">Ripple protocol</a> automatically matches buyers and sellers.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="secure">Secure</h5>
					<p>Because Ripple is a distributed system, it has no single point of weakness or attack, and no one has special access to the network. As a result it is protected from the price-manipulation associated with traditional currency exchanges. As further safeguards, the <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>/currency/#xrp-security-system">XRP security system</a> prevents the network from abuse, and the dynamic scalability system allows the network to process exchange orders even under extreme load.</p>

					<p>Ripple smart contracts is a scripting language built into RTXP that allows complex financial instruments to be fully automated. Subscriptions, escrow, auctions, crowd-funding, and more -- the possibilities of smart contracts are limitless.</p>
						<blockquote>“Contracts makes Ripple extensible. It lets other developers come in and add completely new features to the Ripple network.  It’s every engineer’s dream to work on a component like this.” <br>

					<h5 id="federation-api">Federation API</h5>
					<p>The Federation API is a simple naming protocol based on the same conventions as email.  
					Customers at one business can send payments to customers at another simply by specifying a destination domain. For example, Bob could send a payment to Alice by directing his payment to Alice3000@facebook.com.</p>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="capture-the-spread">Capture the Spread</h5>
					<p>Because so many currencies and payments flow through Ripple, there is a constant demand for liquidity. This creates a fantastic opportunity for <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>/partners/">market makers</a> to turn a profit and provide a valuable service.</p>
