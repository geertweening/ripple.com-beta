					<h5 id="math-based">Math-Based</h5>
					<p>Ripple is powered by <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>/protocol/#math-based">mathematical algorithms</a> and XRP obeys fixed rules that can never be changed. That’s what makes it so secure and reliable. Because no person or organization controls XRP, it cannot be created, falsified, or duplicated.</p> 
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="direct">Direct</h5>
					<p>XRP payments are direct and peer-to-peer. XRP can be used without any third-parties, intermediaries, or other institutions.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="distributed">Distributed</h5>
					<p>XRP transactions are automatically processed by a global network of computers running the Ripple transaction protocol.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="no-counterparty-risk">No Counterparty Risk</h5>
					<p>No counterparty risk = no chargebacks, frozen accounts, or processing delays. Paying with XRP is as direct and easy as paying with cash.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="no-fees">No Fees</h5>
					<p>XRP can be sent directly between any Ripple account without any transaction, network, or operator fees. (The only exception is the XRP security cost, see below.)</p>
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="xrp-security-system">XRP Security System</h5>
					<p>XRP plays an important security service within the Ripple network. Every Ripple transaction destroys a tiny amount of XRP. This XRP security cost is insignificant to any normal Ripple user -- even extremely high-volume users will lose, at most, the equivalent of a few pennies. However abusive users who attempt to spam the network with excessive transactions will soon run out of XRP and be forced to stop.</p>
 				</section>
 				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="xrp-fixes-a-flaw-in-the-internet"></h5>
					<div class="thumbnail centered">
						<h6>XRP fixes a flaw in the Internet.</h6>
						<p>One weakness with the design of the Internet is that it allows an unlimited number of requests. As a result, web servers can be overloaded by malicious Denial of Service attacks. These attacks are a constant logistical challenge and cost businesses billions of dollars. The inventors of Ripple wanted to protect the Ripple network from these attacks and created the XRP security cost -- a tiny cost for transactions that only impacts abusive users. If the Internet charged a similar security cost, it would be a much safer system.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="xrp-reserves">XRP Reserves</h5>
					<p>Another security measure is the XRP reserve system. The XRP reserve is a minimum amount of XRP needed for actions that requires network resources. These XRP reserves are negligible for any normal user, the equivalent of less than dollar. However attempts to overload the network with excessive actions becomes too costly.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="the-two-types-of-xrp-reserves">The Two Types of XRP Reserves</h5>
					<p><strong>The Account Reserve</strong> is a minimum amount of XRP needed to activate a Ripple account. It prevents the creation of excessive accounts that could overload the network.</p>
					<p><strong>The Action Reserve</strong> is a minimum amount of XRP needed for each action that requires network resources. For example, each open trust line or open order in the <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>/distributed-fx">distributed currency exchange</a> requires the action reserve.</p> 
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="pathway-independent">Pathway Independent</h5>
					<p>Sending money of any kind is easy in Ripple -- but sending XRP is the easiest of all. Payments in traditional currencies require a <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>/payment-network/#pathways">pathway</a> between the sender and the receiver, but XRP is pathway-independent. When two users cannot find a payment pathway, they can always use XRP as an alternative currency.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="valuable">Valuable</h5>
					<p>XRP has real-world value. How much? That’s up to you to decide. Just like every other currency, XRP value fluctuates based on the market. You can see the value of XRP at <a href="https://ripplecharts.com/">RippleCharts</a> or by checking out the exchange rates in Ripple’s <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>/distributed-fx">distributed currency exchange</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="no-inflation">No Inflation</h5>
					<p>The number of XRP never increases. That means the value of XRP never inflates. When a currency is known and finite, it’s much easier to value than a currency that changes in quantity. You don’t have to worry about more of it being created. Instead, you can decide for yourself how useful it is, how rare it is, and how much you value it.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="distribution">Distribution</h5>
					<p>How do you get XRP? Easy. You can either buy XRP or get them for free. Remember, it only takes a few XRP to activate your account and access the full power of the Ripple <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>/payment-network/">payment network</a>.</p>
