					<h5 id="peer-to-peer">Peer-to-Peer</h5>
					<p>XRP transactions are automatically processed by a global network of computers running the <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>payment-network/#peer-to-peer">Ripple transaction protocol.</a></p>

					<h5 id="cross-currency-payments">Cross-Currency Payments</h5>
					<p>Thanks to Ripple’s revolutionary distributed currency exchange, cross-currency payments are effortless. Send a payment in dollars, euros, or pounds and it can arrive as yen, rupees, or yuan -- and the exchange automatically happens at the best available rate.</p>

					<h5 id="secure">Secure</h5>
					<p>All accounts and transactions are cryptographically secure and algorithmically verified. Payments can only be authorized by the account holder and all payments are processed automatically without any third-parties or intermediaries. And because Ripple is a distributed system, there is no single point of weakness or attack.</p>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="accessible-to-everyone">Accessible to Everyone</h5>
					<p>Anyone with an Internet connection can create a Ripple account in seconds. It’s not just convenient—Ripple offers financial services to millions of people around the world without access to banks or services.</p>

					<h5 id="tiny-fees">Tiny Fees</h5>
					<p>Ripple is designed to be the cheapest payment system on the Internet. Payments made using XRP, <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>currency">the native currency of the Ripple network</a>, are free except for <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>currency/#xrp-security-system">a tiny security cost</a>. Other currencies -- US dollars, euros, yuan, etc. -- can be sent within the network at rates far cheaper than those offered by traditional payment providers.</p>

					<div class="thumbnail centered">
						<h6>What makes Ripple so much cheaper than traditional payment systems?</h6>
						<p>most payment systems are controlled by for-profit organizations that charge buyers and sellers for the privilege of making payments. In contrast, the Ripple payment network is controlled by a free <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>protocol/">Internet protocol</a> that can be used by anyone.</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="no-merchant-fees">No Merchant Fees</h5>
					<p>Receiving payments in Ripple is always free. That means merchants always get 100% of their payment. Goodbye transaction fees. Hello profit margin.</p> 
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="micropayments">Micropayments</h5>
					<p>With Ripple, you can make payments of any size. A penny? One tenth of a penny? No problem. Micropayments make new pricing systems and business models possible.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="irreversible">Irreversible</h5>
					<p>Because Ripple payments are processed automatically by the <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>protocol/">Ripple protocol</a>, they cannot be reversed by any third-party. In that way, Ripple payments are a lot like cash.</p>

				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="gateways">Gateways</h5>
					<p>Ripple gateways are organizations that allow you to move money in and out of the Ripple network. As a result, most Ripple users will want to have an association with at least one gateway. Understanding gateways is an important part of understanding Ripple.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="guide-section">
					<h5 id="why-are-gateways-so-important"></h5>
					<div class="thumbnail centered">
						<h6>Why are gateways so important?</h6>
						<p>Gateways provide a valuable service within the Ripple ecosystem: they facilitate deposits and withdrawals.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Example #1.</strong> Someone sends $100 to your Ripple account. You now have a $100 account balance that you can hold, trade, or send without any third-party assistance. However, if you want to withdraw the $100, you need to create a relationship with a gateway. Once you sign-up with the gateway, you can withdraw the $100 as a bank transfer, check, cash, or whatever other withdrawal methods offered by the gateway.</li>
							<li><strong>Example #2.</strong> You want to trade currencies on Ripple’s distributed currency exchange. You find a local gateway and send $100 from your bank account. $100 appears in your Ripple account balance. Now you can begin trading.</li>
						</ul>

					<h5 id="a-federated-network">A Federated Network</h5>
					<p>Ripple was invented to help unify the many disconnected parts of the financial system into a single federated system. Because <a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>protocol/">the Ripple protocol</a> is shared, independent businesses and their customer bases become interconnected on the same payment network. As this federated network expands, its utility and value grows. Friction disappears. Efficiency rises. Payments becomes cheaper and faster. Commerce accelerates. Prosperity grows. This is the promise of a federated payment network.</p>
					<div class="thumbnail centered">
						<p>Email is an example of a federated system. Because email providers all use SMTP, Gmail customers can send emails to Yahoo customers simply by specifying the domain “@yahoo.com.” It wasn’t always so easy. In the early days of the internet, a CompuServe customer could only send emails to other CompuServe customers. Fortunately, the adoption of SMTP created a federated email system. Today, the idea of a non-federated email system seems absurd.</p>

					<h5 id="bridge-payments">Bridge Payments</h5>
					<p>A bridge payment is a payment sent from the Ripple network to an external account. For example, using the Bitcoin Bridge, payments can be sent from Ripple to any Bitcoin account. Other bridges are being developed, including an email bridge, a SMS bridge, and a bank-account bridge. Ultimately, bridge payments will allow Ripple users to send money to any kind of account.</p>
